            <!-- write a paragraph explaining why your person is so great  -->
            <p>  On February 25, 2015, Camacho and three other people were in a car accident on the road from Angostura, Sinaloa. Camacho was returning from a performance at a music festival, Carnaval de Mocorito. Camacho and two others died and one person was injured. They were riding in a 1994 Honda Accord when Camacho lost control. The accident reportedly occurred at two in the morning on highway Angostura- La Reforma. Camacho died on impact. It is unclear whether he was driving intoxicated although it was reported he was driving at excessive speed. He had posted a video on his Facebook page a day before his death, inviting his fans and "all the beautiful ladies out there" to attend his next concert in March 2015. He died at the young age of 22.
